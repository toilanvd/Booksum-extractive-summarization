       "      <td>A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'</td>\n",

       "      <td>A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .</td>\n",

In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy.

'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game.

His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                    A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'   \n",

Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .   \n",

Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans (he was famously in attendance when England lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Australia in 2003), the Prince is by no means the only one. His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.   \n",
