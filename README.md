# Book-SUMMER
Extractive long text summarization using heuristics, meta-heuristics models like Genetic Algorithm and some Deep Learning models like LSTM and Transformer.

To know details about how this works and testing results, please read the file "Book summarization (phase 1 - Unsupervised methods).pdf" or "Book summarization (phase 2 - GAlabelled with smallDLs).pdf".
